  s.description  = <<-DESC
    * Straightforward
        * If it did happen -> Event
        * If it should happen -> Request
        * To fulfill Request -> Feedback loop
    * Declarative
        * System behavior is first declaratively specified and effects begin after subscribe is called => Compile time proof there are no "unhandled states"
    * Debugging is easier
        * A lot of logic is just normal pure function that can be debugged using Xcode debugger, or just printing the commands.

    * Can be applied on any level
        * [Entire system](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
        * application (state is stored inside a database, CoreData, Firebase, Realm)
        * view controller (state is stored inside `system` operator)
        * inside feedback loop (another `system` operator inside feedback loop)
    * Works awesome with dependency injection
    * Testing
        * Reducer is a pure function, just call it and assert results
        * In case effects are being tested -> TestScheduler
    * Can model circular dependencies
    * Completely separates business logic from effects (Rx).
        * Business logic can be transpiled between platforms (ShiftJS, C++, J2ObjC)
